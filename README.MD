Here's a basic `README.md` file for your project:
# Patient Department Suggestion System

This project is an Express.js web application that provides department suggestions based on patient queries. It uses OpenAI's API to process patient information and suggest the appropriate department. The application also stores patient queries and suggestions in a SQLite database and allows users to view a list of previous queries.

## Features

- **Patient Query Form:** Submit patient details to receive a department suggestion.
- **Patient Profile Display:** View detailed patient profiles, including medication history and emergency status.
- **Print OPD Ticket:** Generate and print an OPD ticket for the patient.
- **SQLite Database:** Stores patient queries, profiles, and suggestions for later retrieval.
- **Patient History:** View a list of all previous patient queries and suggestions.
- **Loading Screen:** Displays a loading screen while processing the patient's request.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-department-suggestion.git
    cd patient-department-suggestion
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:**

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

4. **Initialize the SQLite database:**

    The database will be automatically initialized when you start the server if it doesn't already exist.
